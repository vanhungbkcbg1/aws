***Amazon S3 Standard***:
>offers high durability, high availability, low latency, and high
performance object storage for general purpose use ****dat nhat****

***Amazon S3 Standard â€“ Infrequent Access***:
>offers the same durability, low
latency, and high throughput as Amazon S3 Standard, but is designed for long-lived, less
frequently accessed data ***dat thu 2***

***Amazon S3 Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS)***
>dung cho data it truy cap, data co the tai tao duoc

***Amazon Glacier storage class***
>offers secure, durable, and extremely low-cost
cloud storage for data that does not require real-time access, such as archives and long-term
backups. To keep costs low, Amazon Glacier is optimized for infrequently accessed data
where a retrieval time of several hours is suitable ***dung cho data it truy cap,cho muc dich luu tru la chinh, re nhat***

***Object Lifecycle Management***
>Using Amazon S3 lifecycle configuration rules, you can significantly reduce your storage costs
by automatically transitioning data from one storage class to another or even automatically
deleting data after a period of time

***Multipart Upload***

***Store Class([Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html))***
1. S3 Standard
   >The default storage class. If you don't specify the storage class when you upload an object, Amazon S3 assigns the S3 Standard storage class
2. Reduced Redundancy
   >The Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) storage class is designed for noncritical, reproducible data that can be stored with less redundancy than the S3 Standard storage class
3. S3 Intelligent-Tiering
   >The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by automatically 
   >moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier, 
   >without performance impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers 
   >automatic cost savings by moving data on a granular object level between two access tiers, a frequent access tier and a lower-cost infrequent access tier, when access patterns change. The Intelligent-Tiering storage class is ideal if you want to optimize storage costs automatically for long-lived data when access patterns are unknown or unpredictable
   
   >The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class stores objects in two access tiers: one tier that is optimized for frequent access and another lower-cost tier that is optimized for infrequently accessed data. For a small monthly monitoring and automation fee per object, Amazon S3 monitors access patterns of the objects in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class and moves objects that have not been accessed for 30 consecutive days to the infrequent access tier
