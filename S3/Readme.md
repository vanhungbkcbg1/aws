### The difference between "Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new access control lists (ACLs)" and "Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any access control lists" in Amazon S3 Block Public Access is as follows:

- "Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new access control lists (ACLs)" only affects new ACLs and does not change the public access status of existing buckets and objects in your AWS account. When this feature is enabled, any new buckets or objects that you create will be private by default, and you will need to explicitly grant access to specific AWS identities if you want them to be able to access the buckets and objects.

- "Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any access control lists" affects both new and existing ACLs, making all buckets and objects in your AWS account private by default. When this feature is enabled, you will need to explicitly grant access to specific AWS identities if you want them to access any of the buckets and objects.

- In summary, the first option provides less restrictive public access control, while the second option provides more restrictive public access control by making all buckets and objects private by default.
