### Actions defined by Amazon S3

[The Resource types column indicates whether each action supports resource-level permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazons3.html). If there is no value for this column, you must specify all resources ("*") in the Resource element of your policy statement. If the column includes a resource type, then you can specify an ARN of that type in a statement with that action
